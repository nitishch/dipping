Paper: Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling by Alexei
       A. Efros, Thomas Leung

Databases: Brodatz texture images from
           http://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=textures
           
Evaluation: Since the paper is concerned with the texture synthesis,
            we take a portion of image from the available texture and
            try to recreate the original texture.  We can measure the
            performance by comparing the result with original texture
            using some distance metric.
